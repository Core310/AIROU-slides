## Week of 24 (last week)
- Encountered issues with odometry not publishing due to VESC misconfiguration; resolved by reflashing and reconfiguring motor controller.
- Corrected map topic issues caused by using the wrong Nav2 image; switched to bringup image for full functionality.
- Fixed "Robot out of bounds of the costmap" error by aligning map frame correctly.
- Investigated timestamp errors and "No map received" issue in RViz.
- Identified proper topic controlling wheel motion.
- Created and tested converter node to handle Twist vs TwistStamped topic mismatch, enabling proper robot drive control.
- Generated pre-map point cloud but faced odom alignment and playback issues.
- Began setup of EKF-based robot_localization node to support SLAM stability.

## Week of 27 (this week)
- Resolved LiDAR communication issue; SLAM node now runs but map generation still blocked by faulty odometry.
- Explored using robot_localization to fuse IMU with scan data instead of relying on odom.
- Tested and reset F1TENTH default VESC configuration multiple times due to breakages.
- Diagnosed and corrected drift from right wheel alignment issue.
- Spent significant time manually recalculating odometry parameters.
- Confirmed SLAM failure linked to odometry drift.
- Detected malfunction in leftmost wheel when moving forward.

## Current Status
- Odometry response remains inconsistent: turning in RViz is less sensitive than physical turning.
- Need to adjust appropriate parameter in F1TENTH config to synchronize real-world rotation with simulation.
