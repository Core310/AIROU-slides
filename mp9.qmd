# Currently 

- Odom isn't working nicely, turning the robot doesn't corrospond to turning in rviz (its much less sensitive, which @param do I change for this?)
- See f1tenth config setup guide for it

# Sunday
- Lidar issue was fixed 
- SLAM node works (but it doesn't map due to false odometry)
- Fixed some small git issues

# Monday
- Looked into robot_localization to use for slam tb (fuse imu with /scan instead of odom topic)
- tested default vesc config file frm f1tenth
- Reset the vesc again (it broke)
- Fixed the f1tenth having a slight drift due to right wheel facing outward (apparently this is also an issue students are facing in the class)
- Manually calculated the odom topic (This took pretty much the entire day)
- Played with SLAM more, confirm its due to the odom drift error 
- I found out that the leftmost wheel isnt working when slowly going foward
