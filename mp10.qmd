## Project updates
- looking at papers and planning how to go foward now..
- Am I doing sim only? 
- sim2real issues? I assume will be handling that next sem?
- Currently exploring different sim enviorments, was looking at:
	- Pure gym with unity
	- isacc gym
- What is idea to feed the RL model?
	- YOLO model to classify stop signs and read the text to ensure it says stop? (simple text model would stop any ANY stop words)
	- Canny Edge to grab lane filling? (Or some UFLD)
	- Or should it only use the RGB vision? 

## general lab things
- website fixed, alumni links fixed
- tidied up documentation a little (but I would likely focus on this once I'm free of this RL model..)		- Unsure the sim2real issues performing on minicity versus the UFLD dataset
