# This week
- Mostly focused on exams
- Looked into refactoring arcbot documentation and overall RL projcet (once finished) 
	- Looking at [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/Obsidian-compatibility#configuration) and [digital_garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) for hosting
	- super simple wiki links and editing, minimal setup to edit and easy navigation
- Reconfigured some tailscale settings for lab mesh network
- Started looking into sim2real with the RL project
