# This week arcpro_rl
- Busy with recalibrating cars and school work
- Cleaned up documentation for the robot, later to be published on [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)

# Hopefully done by next week:
- Start refactoring old airou minicity docs to new ros2 docs.
- Finish recalibrating cars and have working slam example. 


# Current Issues 
When making very short turns, the bot failes to localize. Likely due to steering_angle_to_servo_offset? 
```yaml
  ros__parameters:
    # erpm (electrical rpm) = speed_to_erpm_gain * speed (meters / second) + speed_to_erpm_offset
    speed_to_erpm_gain: 4571.5 #original erpm gain 4614
    # Need to change for odom to be calc accurately?
    speed_to_erpm_offset: 0.0

    # servo value (0 to 1) =  steering_angle_to_servo_gain * steering angle (radians) + steering_angle_to_servo_offset
    steering_angle_to_servo_gain: -1.0
    #todo this prolly needs to be changed..
    #I may need to change this??
    steering_angle_to_servo_offset: 0.4705 #originally 4687
    #higher = left, lower = right need .46
```
